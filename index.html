		<p class="lead">A mother&rsquo;s memory never unspools in order, like a movie plot. It flashes up randomly over time. One moment, Ryan Johanningmeier is a 9-year-old rascal romping up the stairs to tell his mom about an escaped pet snake. Then he&rsquo;s a 21-year-old All-America football player standing next to Peyton Manning.</p>
		<p>Ryan&rsquo;s mom, Sandy Curfman, can rattle off his adventures as though they happened yesterday.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ryan, he was in the fourth grade then, he comes to the top of the steps one night and says, &lsquo;I have good news and bad news, mom.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the bad news?&rsquo; &rdquo; she recalled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The snake got out in the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the good news, honey?&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Football fans may remember Johanningmeier from the waning years of Colorado&rsquo;s golden age, when the Buffaloes flipped from coach Bill McCartney, who first recruited him, to the Rick Neuheisel years to the Gary Barnett teams. Johanningmeier (pronounced Joe-HAN-ing-mye-er) was a versatile athlete who played every position on Colorado&rsquo;s offensive line from 1996-99, a large and nimble blocker who grew up in nearby Lafayette and matured into an All-American.</p>
		<p>Offensive linemen are the silent guardians of football. They tough out a sumo-style existence of hand-to-hand combat for the benefit of someone else. Their purpose is to protect.</p>
		<p>But who protects the protector? Johanningmeier clawed his way onto an NFL roster. But he never played a down as a pro. And, when he died alone in his Lakewood apartment March 9, after he went to bed and never woke up from a lethal overdose of painkillers, football fans had probably forgotten about him. He was 38.</p>
		<p>Ryan&rsquo;s parents, his family, his friends, they remember it all. They remember the love of a son and a buddy, the promise of an enormous football talent, and his daily, endless battle with pain.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be dead right now if he hadn&rsquo;t played football,&rdquo; his mom said.</p>

		<p class="lead">His was a football life, outsized in body and commitment. At 6-foot-7, Johanningmeier would often rest his elbow on the shoulders of teammates. It was a gentle reminder of his enormous frame and a silent reassurance he would keep them safe.</p>
		<p>But former elite athletes in their 30s don&rsquo;t normally die without warning. During his playing career, Johanningmeier underwent seven surgeries, on his wrist, ankle, knees, shoulder and back. Pain wore him down.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t rewrite history. You can&rsquo;t think about what might have been,&rdquo; said Adam Reed, a center who played alongside Johanningmeier at Colorado. &ldquo;Where does any one chain of events start? Where does the train get off track from whatever your original fate was?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier was a dominating lineman at Colorado. As a junior, in 1998, he was among an elite class. Seven of the 10 linemen ahead of him on the all-Big 12 Conference first and second teams played in the NFL. Playboy magazine selected Johanningmeier for its 1999 preseason All-America team and flew him to Phoenix for a weekend party. As he did on CU&rsquo;s line, Johanningmeier found himself standing next to quarterbacks.</p>

		<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s Peyton Manning, the 1998 All-American quarterback and a recent No. 1 draft choice by the Indianapolis Colts, was there to welcome the new crop. He and Johanningmeier posed for a photo.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They look like they&rsquo;re babies,&rdquo; Curfman said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cute.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Their paths would soon go in wildly different directions. Manning was ready to launch what would become a record-setting NFL career. Johanningmeier was preparing for what would become a painful senior season.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If Ryan doesn&rsquo;t get hurt, maybe he&rsquo;s still playing ball,&rdquo; Reed said. &ldquo;Maybe he plays two years and burns out. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While no one knew it at the time, everything changed after Johanningmeier took a hit to his back in the CU spring game in 1999, an injury that would, in subsequent years, send him into a spiral.</p>
		<p>A pile of players chased a fumble. Johanningmeier ran over to help. He hurdled two players and targeted the safety for a block. When he planted his feet, defensive players hit him from each side, straight at his shoulders and square in his back. He bent over backward and landed in the grass.</p>
		<p>The pain was severe. But no one knew the damage. By August, he was ready for preseason drills. When CU&rsquo;s season began, he was listed on practice reports as &ldquo;day to day with back spasms.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>&ldquo;He tried to handle everything himself,&rdquo; said his father, B.J. Johanningmeier. &ldquo;He always wanted to be stoic.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>By the third week of the season, trainers discovered the source of his pain. Johanningmeier had three compressed vertebrae in his back, almost certainly the result of that hit in the spring game. But he kept playing.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a curse of football,&rdquo; Reed said. &ldquo;You get back in and you go. You don&rsquo;t think about it. There&rsquo;s a little bit of meathead to it. But that&rsquo;s required. That&rsquo;s the culture. You&rsquo;re a member of a team. You don&rsquo;t want to let anybody down. You sacrifice yourself for the betterment of the group.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier, a co-captain, played through pain all season, helping CU to an 7-5 record and an Insight.com Bowl victory over Boston College. Cortisone shots &mdash; football&rsquo;s go-to remedy to get injured players back on the field &mdash; helped keep him going.</p>
		<p>It seemed Johanningmeier, with his skill and toughness, was positioned well for the NFL draft. Instead it was the beginning of the end of his time on a football field.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If we could have intervened at any time, that&rsquo;s when we should have,&rdquo; his mother said with the benefit of hindsight. &ldquo;We should have encouraged him he was done. But we didn&rsquo;t know at the time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was his body, his choice. He was young. You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to be crippled the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Johanningmeier had football in his blood. He was a third-generation football player. His grandfather Bill played at Loras College in Iowa after he returned from World War II. Ryan&rsquo;s father, B.J., was a standout defensive lineman at Colorado State in the 1970s who got NFL training camp invitations from Green Bay and Washington. He signed with the Broncos in the 1974 strike year but was cut.</p>
		<p>As a kid, after his parents divorced, Ryan kept a photo on his bedroom wall of his dad playing in a Broncos uniform at San Francisco&rsquo;s Candlestick Park.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was something we always did together &mdash; we always went to football games,&rdquo; B.J. said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of our heritage.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The NFL, Ryan hoped, would justify all the work and the pain. Trainers injected cortisone shots straight into Johanningmeier &rsquo;s spine, from his senior season through pro workouts for scouts. The shots were his shot at the NFL. He couldn&rsquo;t sit or stand for more than 20 minutes at a time, but maybe, hopefully, the pain and inflammation would fade in time for the NFL draft in 2000.</p>
		<p>At the predraft NFL scouting combine in February, Johanningmeier was prospect OL12. Never mind his name. He was numbered meat. Ryan interviewed with 17 teams, including the Broncos. Each team had its own team of doctors, and they all wanted their own set of medical tests. X-rays, MRIs, blood tests, urine samples.</p>
		<p>The St. Louis Rams used a tag system on prospects. Yellow tags for off-field issues. Red tags for health issues. Ryan got a red tag.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like trading horses,&rdquo; B.J. said.</p>
		<p>While his history of injuries gave NFL teams pause, Johanningmeier&rsquo;s size and versatility were selling points. He had played every position on the Buffs&rsquo; line during his career, including tight end.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He just adjusted,&rdquo; B.J. said. &ldquo;He spent a lot of time figuring it out rather than grumbling about it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Scouts and coaches encouraged him with their predraft predictions. Some told him he might go as high as the third round. The NFL picked 254 players in seven rounds over two days. Johanningmeier wasn&rsquo;t chosen. Minutes after the final pick, his phone lit up. His health issues had scared away every team from drafting him, but five organizations wanted him to sign as a free agent.</p>
		<p>The Atlanta Falcons, coached by Dan Reeves, offered him a two-year contract with injury stipulations and a $12,000 signing bonus. He quickly accepted.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was exactly where he wanted to be,&rdquo; Reed said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it was so hard when it ended.&rdquo; </p>

		<p class="lead">Johanningmeier&rsquo;s sacrifices piled up. A rookie free agent plays at the lowest rung of an NFL training camp ladder, hardly noticed. The Falcons&rsquo; head college scout knew him as Ryan Yorgenheimer. He would never get the Falcons&rsquo; attention or make the 53-man roster if he didn&rsquo;t play. So Johanningmeier tried to play through his pain in training camp, even if the pain made him play poorly.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We talked about it. I asked him if he really wanted to keep going,&rdquo; B.J. said. &ldquo;He told me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to give it a shot.&rsquo; I asked him, &lsquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll hold up?&rsquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; his son said.</p>
		<p>His dad understood.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I remember my dad, he said to me, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s up to you if you want to play,&rsquo; &rdquo; B.J. recalled. &ldquo; &lsquo;But 20 years from now, will you say you wish you&rsquo;d given it a shot?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
		<p>The Falcons were scheduled for an August preseason game in Tokyo. But the pain in Johanningmeier&rsquo;s back was too severe for him to sit on a plane for 15 hours. Instead, he flew to Los Angeles to meet with a back specialist.Doctors discovered he had congenital spinal stenosis &mdash; he was born with a narrow spine. That spring game hit in 1999 was so painful because it squeezed a disc out between his vertebrae, like a fist closing around a wet sponge. It put a vise grip on his spinal nerves.</p>
		<p>A surgeon cut into his back and removed part of a herniated disc and some nerves near his spine. The Falcons put him on their injured reserve list, ending his season. The pain did not subside once he recovered. So he retired after the season.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He always said: &lsquo;Football is what I do. It&rsquo;s not who I am.&rsquo; But he put so much time into it,&rdquo; his dad said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Football is the kind of sport where one day you&rsquo;re wearing a helmet and it&rsquo;s all broken in, and the next day you&rsquo;ll never wear it again. It&rsquo;s a terminal ending. Whether you want it to be or not.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Before football wore down Johanningmeier like an aged coal miner, crippling his back, he was full of fun and shenanigans. There was the time in high school when he watched &ldquo;Happy Gilmore&rdquo; and tried to hit a shuffle-step golf shot off the tee like Adam Sandler.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He thought it was the funniest movie he&rsquo;d ever seen,&rdquo; said Rob Grall, a close friend of Ryan&rsquo;s from Centaurus High. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re on the 15th tee the next day, and he hits this thing and it goes straight left, right at a big bay window of a giant house.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He lived in the &ldquo;Fat Shack,&rdquo; they called it, a house he shared with three other CU football players and a tennis player. They watched marathon TV sessions of &ldquo;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>&ldquo;He and I did a lot of stuff that neither of us did with anybody else,&rdquo; aid Reed, one of Ryan&rsquo;s roommates. &ldquo;Just goofy, dumb stuff.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>When Johanningmeier&rsquo;s NFL dreams fell through, he came back to Boulder. He was different, his friends said. When the time comes to reinvent yourself after college, the transition can be a challenge. Johanningmeier&rsquo;s turn was more complicated. He had touched the big leagues, if only briefly, but it washed away in a flash.</p>
		<p>With the Falcons, Ryan&rsquo;s back injury turned into three back injuries. The compressed vertebrae in the middle of his spine caused more discs to swell and nerves to pinch, in his lower and upper back.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They were like dominoes,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
		<p>With football over, Johanningmeier used his business degree in management systems from Colorado to create a home-based information technology business, helping people and companies set up websites and run networks. He also occasionally worked as a spotter in the press box at Buffs football games.</p>
		<p>And he began collecting broken-down pinball machines. Maybe he saw himself the same way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d buy them and fix them up, but he&rsquo;d need someone to help him lift them up onto a box,&rdquo; Grall said. &ldquo;He would try to do it, and he couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d be like &lsquo;Dude, just stop.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
		<p>His only relief came with heavy doses of pain medication. Doctors prescribed narcotics. But there were no remedies. Surgery meant cutting through his chest and ribs and pulling out his organs to reach his spine. There was no guarantee it would help. So he stayed on the pain meds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The procedure that could possibly alleviate his pain had a 50 percent success rate,&rdquo; Reed said. &ldquo;And he was like, &lsquo;Well, hell, that&rsquo;s no kind of chance. A 50-50 shot?&rsquo; At that point, he was more of a realist.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His friends were deeply loyal to him, and he to them. While he suffered through the pain, Johanningmeier kept a lineman&rsquo;s code. Always the protector. When Grall was in a hospital, Ryan was the first to visit. When Reed&rsquo;s wife gave birth to a daughter, Ryan was quick to visit.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want to come across as needing help or having something wrong,&rdquo; Grall said. &ldquo;He hid it from some people.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">They charge inmates for Advils in jail. Johanningmeier learned this quickly. Two rust-colored pills were all he had to curb the pain. He was also withdrawing.</p>
		<p>For more than a decade, Johanningmeier was addicted to narcotic pain meds, his mother said. He was prescribed oxycodone and oxymorphone, two powerful opiates, to treat three back injuries that caused him severe pain all day, every day.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When people are really in pain, to where it&rsquo;s controlling their life, we can&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to assume there&rsquo;s a remedy. It&rsquo;s just a back injury. There must be a fix. But there wasn&rsquo;t. So Johanningmeier took narcotics like they were daily vitamins.</p>
		<p>For football players, this isn&rsquo;t unusual. In October, former New York Giants safety Tyler Sash died after accidentally overdosing on two powerful pain meds he was taking for a series of injuries he suffered as a player.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier was usually good about handling the meds. He knew not to take them during the day while he worked. But when the work day was done, and the pain was peaking, he would pop his pills. In July 2014, police found him asleep in his car with the engine running. He wasn&rsquo;t driving a moving car, but it&rsquo;s still illegal. He was sentenced to four weeks in jail this past February for driving under the influence.</p>
		<p>Jail was a good thing for him, in a way. There was no oxycodone and no methadone, another strong synthetic drug he had been prescribed as part of his pain management. For four weeks, he could take only Advils. So he suffered through withdrawals and detoxed. He lost 30 pounds.</p>
		<p>Getting off the drugs was the easy part. Getting out from under the pain was nearly impossible. It never went away. So he refilled his prescriptions for more meds as soon as he got out.</p>
		<p>On the first Saturday in March, Johanningmeier walked from his apartment in Lakewood to a nearby bank to deposit paychecks he missed while in jail. As always, he carried the pain with him like a backpack. On his way home, he passed out and fell forward, hitting his head on a concrete curb. Neighbors found him unconscious and called an ambulance. He had overdosed. He was rushed to the hospital and revived.</p>
		<p>By Sunday afternoon he was back home and e-mailed his mother. He didn&rsquo;t tell her about his hospital trip.</p>
		<p>The Jefferson County coroner later estimated that Johanningmeier died quickly sometime Monday afternoon. His mom thinks he knew something was wrong. He tried to climb into bed in the middle of a work day. That&rsquo;s where he was found. The coroner&rsquo;s report stated he died of a toxic overdose of opiates and an enlarged heart.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It happened again, and nobody was there to save him,&rdquo; Curfman said.</p>

		<p class="lead">If you watch a football game and follow only the ball, you&rsquo;ll be staring mostly at the quarterback and rarely at his protection. Those linemen, the invisible working stiffs who get beaten down and knocked over only to climb back up, are invisible bodyguards.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The guys who are special offensive linemen, who are hard and tough and can handle those ups and downs, and keep growing, they develop a great sense of responsibility,&rdquo; said Tom Cable, Johanningmeier&rsquo;s line coach from 1998-99 and now an assistant coach with the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the caretakers &mdash; we take care of the quarterback, we take care of the runner, we take care of the team,&rdquo; Cable said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a good team, then your offensive line is a big part of it. Their spirit and their vibe is the core of good football teams.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At a Colorado practice in 1999, Cable called out Johanningmeier in front of the team. A burly former lineman himself, Cable has a booming voice. The field fell silent.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier trembled. Was he in trouble? Did he miss a block? Was his toughness being challenged? He expected his coach to wring him out. Cable instead congratulated him. Johanningmeier had just been voted a preseason All-American. His team cheered.</p>
		<p>Football was the thing that Johanningmeier did well. It was also the thing that hurt him. But how can you give up on your gift?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There were many times I asked him,&rdquo; his mom said, &ldquo; &lsquo;Ryan, now that you know all that you know, would you still go back and repeat this whole life again?&rsquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
