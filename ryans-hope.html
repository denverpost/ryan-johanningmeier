		<p class="lead">A needle entered his spine.</p>
		<p>It was July, and this was Ryan Johanningmeier&rsquo;s fourth epidural for a herniated disc, his second in four months. A doctor injected cortisone into the space between his spinal cord and vertebra, with the hope of soothing the inflamed fluid at the center of his spine.</p>
		<p>The shot hasn&rsquo;t helped. A little more than three weeks ago, he still couldn&rsquo;t sit or stand for more than 20 minutes at a time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It gets to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>But this is what Johanningmeier has been willing to endure for a shot at his dream job as one of only about 250 offensive linemen in the National Football League. The starting pay is $191,000, with the possibility of liberal pay increases.</p>
		<p>But it was no sure thing. Few in the NFL can even pronounce his name. It&rsquo;s not Yohoningmayor, Gigermeister or Yorgenheimer, all of which he&rsquo;s heard in the past six months. It&rsquo;s easier than it looks: Joe-han (rhymes with tan)-ing-my-er.</p>
		<p>Take away his giant name and giant frame (6-foot-7, 305 pounds), and he&rsquo;s just a person. As he likes to say, a football player one day out of seven.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier, 23, pursued his dream from Centaurus High School in Lafayette to the University of Colorado. And on the opening day of the 2000 NFL season, Johanningmeier&rsquo;s name was on the roster of the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
		<p>But instead of taking the turf at the Georgia Dome last Sunday when the Falcons beat San Francisco, Johanningmeier was much like thousands of NFL fans who tracked the day&rsquo;s action on restaurant televisions.</p>
		<p>He couldn&rsquo;t even watch the Atlanta game. Because the Falcons did not sell out their game, it was blacked out locally. That meant he had to depend on the ticker creeping across the bottom of the screen just to find out how his teammates were doing.</p>
		<p>He ate by himself.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier could have attended the game, but he didn&rsquo;t want to experience that useless feeling an injured player gets trying to stay out of the way of healthy teammates. Plus, standing on the sidelines for three hours was about two hours and 15 minutes more than his back could take.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier remains on the Falcons&rsquo; roster, but you won&rsquo;t see him playing against the Broncos when the Falcons visit Mile High Stadium on Sunday. He will be recuperating from back surgery performed Thursday.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Modest beginning</h3>

		<p class="lead">With the genes of a former defensive lineman who calls his own time in the NFL &ldquo;a dream ago,&rdquo; Ryan grew enough to earn a college scholarship. His commitment to Colorado in 1995 made few headlines, but he became a three-year starter and all-Big 12 guard who played every position on the line, plus tight end.</p>
		<p>That versatility was his greatest asset heading into April&rsquo;s NFL draft. His biggest problem was his history with injuries. By the end of his college career, he&rsquo;d undergone a combined five surgeries on his wrist, knee and shoulder.</p>
		<p>But Johanningmeier had plenty of advantages. His family had money. He is the son of Sandy Curfman and B.J. Johanningmeier. B.J. played three years in the NFL and had contacts around the league. That led Ryan to Leigh Steinberg, football&rsquo;s most famous deal-maker.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very inquisitive,&rdquo; said Dave Dunn, one of Steinberg&rsquo;s partners at the agency Steinberg, Moorad and Dunn. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s the first person who&rsquo;s taken notes in an initial discussion since Steve Young. He asked the right questions.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Degree a priority</h3>

		<p class="lead">Ryan was smart enough to recognize the need for a back-up plan, which is why he took no cash advance from Steinberg and wrapped up his undergraduate business degree in December before pursuing his NFL goal.</p>
		<p>In early February, done with school, he was doing little more than lifting, stretching, running, eating and playing video games. He had plenty of time to think. In a few weeks, he would fly to the NFL&rsquo;s combine in Indianapolis, where the nation&rsquo;s top prospects get drilled physically and mentally by their prospective employers. He was a little nervous. Where he would be drafted &mdash;if he would be drafted &mdash;largely would be determined there.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not that it&rsquo;s a cut-throat, dastardly business,&rdquo; he said before pausing and rolling his eyes. &ldquo;You hope it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Either way, he promised he wouldn&rsquo;t let the draft define his personality: &ldquo;Football is what I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not who I am.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>What he is is his father&rsquo;s son, tall and wide and dark-haired, quick with a joke, maintaining a notebook on each of his workouts to keep himself honest. Little different from the charts B.J., a real estate salesman, keeps to remind himself of his sales goals, or those the two kept to make sure Ryan maintained good grades.</p>
		<p>B.J. and Sandy divorced when Ryan was 4, and both remarried. That gave Ryan four parents watching over him &mdash;B.J. and Debby Johanningmeier in Fort Collins and Jim and Sandy Curfman in Louisville.</p>
		<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t hide her fears heading into the draft process.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You know they&rsquo;re not going to take the kind of attention and care they took in college,&rdquo; she said of Ryan&rsquo;s future coaches. &ldquo;This is a business.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And in this business, all your assets had better be in order. In the case of Johanningmeier, that was a problem.</p>
		<p>He would played most of his senior year with a cast on his right wrist, which was still damaged as he headed to the combine Feb. 17. He had the misfortune of fracturing the slowest-healing bone in the body, the navicular bone. Also damaged were some of its surrounding veins, which meant blood had a hard time circulating in the wrist, and that the bone could die.</p>
		<p>He could either let it heal or have total surgical reconstruction with a bone graft, which couldn&rsquo;t guarantee recovery. He let it go.</p>
		<p>At the combine, prospect OL12 spent a Thursday afternoon and most of a Friday getting examined by doctors checking on its progress. For every team that wanted to talk to him there was a team of doctors to examine him. He rotated from room to room, with six team doctors waiting at each station. After he finished, he sat in a hotel restaurant across from the RCA Dome, talking about how they injected radioactive serum into his wrist for a bone scan.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;One more frickin&rsquo; X-ray, and I&rsquo;m going to turn into the Incredible Hulk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get mad, turn green and walk through a wall.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They also took MRIs on his neck, back, left knee and right wrist twice. He had to stay motionless for 50 minutes at a time, so he either slept in the machine or sang songs by The Highwaymen to remain sane.</p>
		<p>Aside from the medical exams, there were the actual physical tests in the dome. He ran the 40-yard dash in 5.2 seconds, which could have been better, but he scored a 29-inch vertical leap, a decent mark. Southern California&rsquo;s Travis Claridge, one of Ryan&rsquo;s eventual teammates, was talking to himself in disgust over his 40 time as he walked into the hotel.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier lost count, guessing he interviewed with 16 or 17 teams, including Denver, Kansas City, New England and Carolina. Assistant coaches and player personnel men sitting in cramped hotel meeting rooms tried to gauge his intelligence and personality. Each seemed to offer him water, which after a while put his mind on the bathroom rather than football.</p>
		<p>As the biggest names got mobbed by the national press, Johanningmeier bounced through the sweaty hotel lobby on perhaps the hottest February day in Indiana history. Back to his room for a nap. Back to the dome. Back to the hospital for more tests.</p>
		<p>He weaved around reporters and past agents, all of whom were limited to that one area, sitting like groupies. One established agent guessed that 70 percent of them were in town to snag the 10 percent of the players who hadn&rsquo;t signed a representative yet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;The Shawshank Redemption&rsquo; in here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier left town with a half dozen T-shirts and hats and relief that the worst was over.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Someone put it best when they told me we&rsquo;re all tomatoes, and they&rsquo;re out grocery shopping,&rdquo; Johanningmeier said.</p>
		<p>Whatever he&rsquo;d done, he&rsquo;d put himself on somebody&rsquo;s shopping list. C.O. Brocato, an old-time scout for Tennessee with a drawl straight from Faulkner, thought Brad Bedell, Johanningmeier&rsquo;s CU teammate, may have been a little tougher, but that Ryan was more skilled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That big fool did good for himself!&rdquo; Brocato announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no complaints.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Mind games begin</h3>

		<p class="lead">Back in Boulder, he continued to work every muscle in his body. Scouts came en masse to CU&rsquo;s March 9 pro day, a chance for all of the Buffaloes&rsquo; pro prospects to impress them. One who saw Johanningmeier predicted he would go in the middle rounds.</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier saw some of these drills as a waste of time, poor gauges of what makes a good football player. How often do offensive linemen sprint 40 yards in a game?</p>
		<p>By early April, he was finding it harder to maintain the discipline he&rsquo;d easily summoned a few weeks back. He&rsquo;d finished most of his workouts. The draft approached.</p>
		<p>The time was getting close to bid farewell to those close to him. He was trying to keep his head while his life was turning surreal. His impending departure was causing trouble with his girlfriend, Jessica Garrow. Adam Reed, one of his buds on CU&rsquo;s offensive line, said he sometimes didn&rsquo;t know what to say around Ryan, because he didn&rsquo;t want to stress him out by bringing up the draft. Ryan didn&rsquo;t wear his heart on his sleeve, either.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for a wily psycho, he&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s not Bill Romanowski,&rdquo; Reed said.</p>
		<p>Ryan relieved the stress by going to London on a whim with mom Sandy. Her idea, her dime. She figured he&rsquo;d never been to Europe and needed a break. In their six days, they watched &ldquo;Starlight Express,&rdquo; the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical performed entirely on roller skates, wandered through Hyde Park, Parliament, Leicester Square.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was a good way to break up the monotony before the draft,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only so long you can work out here every day and wait for it to come. I figured a week off wouldn&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The chaos returned almost as soon as he did. Tampa Bay wanted another interview with him in Florida. That meant dinner in Boulder the night he got back, an early night to sleep with his body clock seven hours fast and a 3 a.m. wake-up to catch a flight to Tampa via Atlanta. After a day of interviews and still more check-ups on his wrist, shoulder and knees, the Buccaneers flew him back to Denver, through Dallas that night. A whirlwind 16 hours.</p>
		<p>The Bucs&rsquo; doctors had told Johanningmeier that Mike Alstott, the team&rsquo;s fullback, had a nearly identical wrist condition, and that he had become an all-pro.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Feeling the draft</h3>

		<p class="lead">April 12 was two days before the start of the draft. Ryan sat in his typical college apartment, replete with neon beer signs, framed Monet and Dali reprints, another of Yoda, a huge Jack Daniel&rsquo;s banner, a poorly rigged sheet over the window to add to the vampire-like atmosphere, two football-player-sized couches and a giant TV.</p>
		<p>He played a video game, &ldquo;NFL 2K.&rdquo; If things went right for him, his name would be included in next year&rsquo;s version.</p>
		<p>He felt cautiously optimistic. In the previous three days, eight teams &mdash;Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, the New York Giants and Jets, Cincinnati, Carolina and Seattle &mdash;had called, asking where he could be reached over the weekend. That was a good sign. Of the 31 flavors out there, he said, only one had to like him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Consequently, none of those teams will probably draft me,&rdquo; he joked.</p>
		<p>He was right.</p>
		<p>The draft began when Cleveland chose Penn State linebacker Courtney Brown. About 90 minutes later, Johanningmeier picked up his tickets at the Pepsi Center&rsquo;s will-call window for Game 2 of the first-round NHL playoff series between Colorado and Phoenix. Watching the draft held no appeal for him.</p>
		<p>As he sat in the worst seats in the house, last row, toward the corner, with friends Rob Grall and R.J. Johnson, he relaxed.</p>
		<p>Ryan knew his cell phone wouldn&rsquo;t ring for a while. Steinberg didn&rsquo;t expect anything to happen until the third round at the earliest, and quite possibly not until after Round 4 began Sunday.</p>
		<p>A call came at 2:30, the first of several false alarms. It was just friends wondering where the party would be that night.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;People have got to stop calling me,&rdquo; Johanningmeier said in a quieter voice. He loosened up again as his mind shifted to the game, which the Avalanche won 3-1.</p>
		<p>Late in the third period, a fight broke out on the ice, and Ryan found himself as a part of the crowd for once, not the object of its attention.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a yard sale out there!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, his father and stepmom, Debby, waited for him at The Barrel House, a Boulder sports bar co-owned by B.J.&rsquo;s brother Dennis. Debby marked on her scorecard every time an offensive lineman was picked. B.J. just kept looking up at one of the restaurant&rsquo;s many televisions.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s getting nervous,&rdquo; Dennis cracked.</p>
		<p>Ryan called B.J.&rsquo;s cell phone to say he didn&rsquo;t feel like meeting them at the restaurant. Debby started talking about how she hoped San Diego drafted him so they&rsquo;d have a sunny city to visit.</p>
		<p>A few claps erupted in the bar, as Ryan&rsquo;s teammate, cornerback Ben Kelly, become the first Buffalo drafted, with the 84th pick by Miami.</p>
		<p>The day ended with no news on Ryan. His friends acted as if someone had died. He wanted to hide from everyone now.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; B.J. said. &ldquo;When he went to CU, there were five guys ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Chilly awakening</h3>

		<p class="lead">Boulder felt chilly that Sunday morning. But Ryan wanted to go outside, so he put on his sunglasses and headed to CU&rsquo;s Kittridge Tennis Center, where his now former girlfriend, Jessica, would play her final tennis match for CU. They had dated for a year and a half, but with so many complications in his life, Ryan had abruptly called things off four weeks earlier.</p>
		<p>Now he wanted to be there for her.</p>
		<p>He grabbed some breakfast bagels and plopped on to the hard metal bleachers to watch. Dunn, the agent, called with the first of many updates. Ryan was glad his agents were still giving him the time of day by the time the fifth round began.</p>
		<p>One of Jessica&rsquo;s roommates asked Ryan how he was doing, then quickly apologized.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to get a little aggravating.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As the temperature climbed, the ice around the tennis court started to melt. Each minute that ticked away was costing him thousands of dollars.</p>
		<p>At 12:15, Jessica lost her first set. &ldquo;This is really starting to (stink), eh?&rdquo; Ryan said.</p>
		<p>His mom called to say the sixth round had begun. Ten minutes later, Bedell called to ask what Ryan was doing. &ldquo;Just ridin&rsquo; the slide,&rdquo; he said with gallows humor.</p>
		<p>At 12:56, another call came. &ldquo;Hello? This is him. Sure. Great. All right. All right. All right. Sounds good. Sounds great.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the news Ryan wanted, but it was something. An Atlanta Falcons official told Ryan he might be their final pick in the seventh round. If not, management wanted to sign him as a free agent. Johanningmeier alerted Dunn, who said three or four teams were interested in signing him after the draft.</p>
		<p>By 1:40, still no word. All of the ice had now melted. Jessica lost in three sets. Ryan was leaning uncomfortably against the back of the fence, and confessed that one of his discs was bothering him again. He had another epidural on Tuesday, but hadn&rsquo;t said anything for fear that word would leak to the teams.</p>
		<p>Another call came at 2:03, another case of we definitely like you, this time from Tennessee offensive line coach Mike Munchak. Ryan informed Dunn, who said the Titans hadn&rsquo;t drafted an offensive lineman. While on the phone, Jessica gave him a nonverbal thumbs up/thumbs down signal to ask Ryan how things looked. Ryan gave her a thumbs down.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The difference between the seventh round and free agency is almost nil economically,&rdquo; he said, repeating what Dunn had told him. &ldquo;At least as a free agent, you&rsquo;ve got some say in wherever you go.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>More calls from his mother. Bedell went to Cleveland with the last pick of the sixth round. CU defensive backs Rashidi Barnes and Damen Wheeler were taken by Cleveland and San Diego.</p>
		<p>Dunn called to say Tampa Bay was backing off Ryan but that four teams &mdash;Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Tennessee and Detroit &mdash;all wanted to talk. He had never interviewed with the first three.</p>
		<p>At 3:35, Ryan&rsquo;s mother called again, this time to tell him the draft was over.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My mother can never just take the information and leave it at that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She has to find a reason to stay on the phone. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so proud of you no matter what happens.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Nothing had happened. Jessica gave him a hug.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">The next best thing</h3>

		<p class="lead">Back at his apartment, the call was Ryan&rsquo;s to make. Based on sales pitches, he liked Detroit best and Atlanta worst, though really it was a stab in the dark. Dunn suggested Atlanta, even though they&rsquo;d drafted USC&rsquo;s Claridge and Tennessee State&rsquo;s Michael Thompson for its line. Ryan had little time to decide.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This was fun until about right now,&rdquo; Ryan said with a grimace. He knew that Atlanta had given him the best deal by far, a $12,000 signing bonus and a two-year deal with a split contract, based on whether he makes the full squad or injured reserve. Pittsburgh offered a $4,000 bonus, Detroit $6,000, each with two- to three-year deals. Carolina and New Orleans came in late, also with lesser deals. No rookie free agent&rsquo;s contract is guaranteed. He got on the phone with the Falcons.</p>
		<p>If he made the active roster, he&rsquo;d make the league minimum of $191,000, half that if he made injured reserve. Had he gone in the third round, he could have commanded $400,000.</p>
		<p>He asked the Falcons official: &ldquo;I guess my question would be how many linemen would be on your roster right now, other than the draft picks?&rdquo; He rolled his eyes and tapped his couch at the answer. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your time frame? Do you need to know right now? &hellip; I think you guys have presented a pretty good argument there.&rdquo; His face was red, maybe from the sun. &ldquo;Is there any way I could talk to my agent and call you right back?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He told Dunn that he wanted to give Detroit one more chance. But when he called the Lions, they told him they&rsquo;d just signed two players.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That made it easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take this Atlanta deal before it goes away.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>On Johanningmeier&rsquo;s return call, they explained how they&rsquo;d lost two veteran free agents from their line and not replaced them, that they weren&rsquo;t thrilled with how their right tackle played and that another veteran had retired. There were only six players on the active roster that they liked.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to just determine the rest of your life in the next five minutes,&rdquo; Ryan said. But he made the final call to Dunn at 4:31.</p>
		<p>Dunn: &ldquo;Atlanta?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ryan: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Dunn: &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ryan then called B.J. to tell him he&rsquo;d found a home. After breaking the news, he replied, &ldquo;Believe me, this was my only choice.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>By 4:41, it was official. He was a Falcon. He had team management on his cell and his agent on his cordless at the same time. They couldn&rsquo;t have sounded more positive to Ryan on the phone, and after his initial hesitation, he seemed happy to be with Atlanta. To be somewhere, anyway.</p>
