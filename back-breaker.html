		<p class="lead">You can&rsquo;t make the club if you sit in the tub.</p>
		<p>That nasty little rhyme played in the back of Ryan Johanningmeier&rsquo;s head all summer.</p>
		<p>The Atlanta Falcons had not signed Johanningmeier as an undrafted free agent to watch him soak in the training room. They signed the University of Colorado graduate to strengthen their offensive line, and they would cut him less slack than their draft picks at the position. Questions about his health kept teams away on draft day. Left uncalled after 254 draft picks, Johanningmeier had to settle for a team he knew next to nothing about. The Falcons hadn&rsquo;t talked to him before the draft and couldn&rsquo;t pronounce his name, but they weren&rsquo;t unfamiliar with the 6-foot-7, 305-pound 23-year-old.</p>
		<p>Reed Johnson, Atlanta&rsquo;s director of college player personnel, gave this scouting report of the player he called Ryan Yorgenheimer: &ldquo;We really like the guy. If we hadn&rsquo;t taken a couple of linemen, we probably would have drafted him. We think he can come in here and compete, either at tackle or guard. We like his size and athleticism. We expect him to have a legitimate chance to make the team and compete for the position.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>How was he competing? The very injuries that frightened away teams on draft day were now jeopardizing Johanningmeier&rsquo;s dream of playing in the National Football League. He had the opportunity to learn from Atlanta head coach Dan Reeves, the man who coached Denver when Johanningmeier watched the Broncos as a child. His offensive line coach was Art Shell, the Hall of Famer who once coached the Los Angeles Raiders.</p>
		<p>They are two of the most respected names in the business. And Leigh Steinberg, Johanningmeier&rsquo;s agent, says Reeves is not doing his client any favors. &ldquo;Reeves is not someone who capriciously expresses interest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In other words, he&rsquo;s not a phony.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And at least it seemed like the Falcons wanted Ryan more than anyone else. To justify that interest, he had to fight through the pain of a broken bone in his wrist and a suddenly worsening back.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Status symbols</h3>

		<p class="lead">In a parking lot full of Navigators and Denalis, Johanningmeier drove a Suzuki.</p>
		<p>The car may not make the man, but in NFL parking lots, it&rsquo;s a sure indication of his place on the totem pole. A family connection had landed Johanningmeier a good long-term rental car rate. But next to some of the sport utility vehicles at Atlanta&rsquo;s practice facility in Suwanee, Ga., his Grand Vitara looked like a Yugo.</p>
		<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns inset-video-right">
			<img src="./img/ryan-j-falcons-shell.jpg" alt="Ryan at Falcons practice" />
			<p class="caption"><span class="photog">Associated Press file photo</span>Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell uses rookie Ryan Johanningmeier as an example during practice in 2000.</p>
		</div>
		<p>No matter. Soon after agreeing to play for the Falcons, he flew from Denver to Atlanta in April to attend introductory meetings, begin workouts and sign his new contract, which would pay him the NFL&rsquo;s minimum of $191,000 if he remained on the active roster all year, plus a $12,000 signing bonus.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It felt good and kind of like you&rsquo;re signing yourself away at the same time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Up at 6:45 the next morning, Johanningmeier began what was now becoming routine &mdash; a battery of medical tests.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Up in lights they had all my greatest hits up there, all my X-rays,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>They checked the progress of his right wrist, which had been broken during Ryan&rsquo;s senior season in Boulder. Tests of blood, urine and eyes followed. He got a passport photo taken in anticipation of the Falcons&rsquo; preseason trip to Tokyo.</p>
		<p>He met Reeves, who set the laid-back tone for the camp, and later that afternoon, Shell taught his new linemen the basic team cadences and protections.</p>
		<p>When Ryan arrived at his locker, he discovered there would be at least one familiar face on the offensive line. He found a note from Alex Bernstein, a practice squad lineman he had met working out with a mutual friend one summer in Colorado. Bernstein had bounced from Baltimore to the New York Jets to Atlanta with the hope of holding on a little longer. He would have plenty to teach Ryan.</p>
		<p>By the end of those first few days, Ryan had his first paycheck, and it felt pretty good.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I walked into the bank, and it&rsquo;s got that Atlanta logo on top, $9,000,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember the last time my checkbook was actually into the thousands.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Johanningmeier exercised on his own at the Falcons&rsquo; training facility through May, but the real work began after Memorial Day, when he returned from Colorado with full bags of clean laundry.</p>
		<p>His life was numbingly mundane. Cooped up in a Fairfield Inn three minutes from the training complex, Johanningmeier worked out from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., wandered to Subway or Wendy&rsquo;s for food, to the mall for a movie. He napped or studied the playbook during down time. Suwanee lies just far enough from Atlanta that a trip downtown takes some effort.</p>
		<p>He couldn&rsquo;t say he was too homesick, though. He talked to his parents about twice a week, and had gotten friendly with Bernstein and some of the rookies. Still, he knew no one outside of the training facility and had not met any women since his breakup with his girlfriend in Boulder before he left.</p>
		<p>Ryan had more pressing concerns, anyway. His injured wrist still presented problems, and he faced a major decision. He could continue ultrasound treatment and ice it four times a day, which hadn&rsquo;t worked very well so far. He could let a doctor take bone marrow from his hip, inject it into the fracture line and hope that could kick-start the healing, but that was risky, and required six weeks in a cast. Finally, he could have a full graft, replace his damaged bone with another. That would take months to heal.</p>
		<p>You can&rsquo;t make the club if you sit in the tub.</p>
		<p>He chose option A. If the navicular bone in his wrist didn&rsquo;t improve, the poor blood supply could cause necrosis, or death to the bone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done an excellent job of not complaining about it,&rdquo; said Ron Medlin, Atlanta&rsquo;s head trainer.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that bad yet, let&rsquo;s put it that way,&rdquo; Johanningmeier reasoned.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Friends and trends</h3>

		<p class="lead">One of 15 offensive linemen competing for a job on the field, No. 73 seemed able to hold his own against the veteran defensive linemen. Newly signed Falcon Brady Smith, a fifth-year NFL veteran out of Colorado State, blew by Johanningmeier the first time they battled, but Ryan stopped him the second time, with some help from Bernstein. Soon, a skirmish broke out. Bernstein&rsquo;s helmet flew off and Ryan tumbled to the ground.</p>
		<p>That night, the tag-teaming pugilists dined in Buckhead, a trendy Atlanta neighborhood.</p>
		<p>For a third-year fringe player, Bernstein can tell some stories. Like the time his rookie year when some Baltimore Ravens veterans stuck him with a $600 bar tab. When he pulled one aside to tell him he couldn&rsquo;t quite afford it, the player ordered two shots of Remy Martin at 50 bucks a pop, made Bernstein drink both and then shoved the check in his face.</p>
		<p>Though Alex and Ryan had only been hanging out for a month, they already had good rapport.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A rookie free agent? That&rsquo;s as low as it gets,&rdquo; Ryan said over his large plate of food.</p>
		<p>Replied Alex over his, &ldquo;Yeah, but at least no one ever expects anything from you.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Inescapable pain</h3>

		<p class="lead">Over the next month, Ryan&rsquo;s wrist faded into the background. For the wrong reasons. One night, he woke up unable to move. It was his back. Again.</p>
		<p>A burning sensation was shooting down his leg to his toes. Johanningmeier waited a week to tell anyone, hoping the pain might disappear. When he finally let team doctors know, they found he had herniated the last disk in his lower back. He took an epidural, where a doctor inserts a cortisone-filled needle directly into the vertebra in an attempt to ease inflammation. He had herniated a different disk as a senior at CU, and knew what he was in for.</p>
		<p>In July, as the Falcons headed to training camp at Furman University in South Carolina, the pain had extended from Ryan&rsquo;s back down his legs. Sometimes when he played, he felt like an 80-year-old man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not detrimental to my play every time out there. But one out of every three or four plays it affects my play out there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Off the field, Johanningmeier could handle himself. When the veterans forced the rookies to sing for them, he walked to the front and crooned George Strait&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amarillo by Morning.&rdquo; He understood that the rookies who squirmed were the ones who got picked on most.</p>
		<p>But on the field, Ryan, third on the depth chart at right tackle, remained an unknown. Quarterbacks Chris Chandler and Tony Graziani playfully called him Gigermeister. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution continued to spell his name incorrectly.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s spelled right on my practice jersey, in the locker room and on my checks,&rdquo; Johanningmeier said.</p>
		<p>His back kept him out of practice, so Reeves, who said he liked his potential, had a hard time judging his talent.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got all the tools. It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting healthy and staying that way,&rdquo; the coach said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to tell.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ryan felt caught in a Catch-22. If he continued to play through the pain, he would play poorly and get cut. If he continued to sit, he feared his coaches would see him as a financial liability and cut him as soon as his health improved. League rules prevent a team from cutting an injured player without compensation.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It could be three months before this thing gets better, which really doesn&rsquo;t fit into my time frame,&rdquo; he said, adding, &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t help but look at it as a guy who&rsquo;s clearly broken right now. Hurt and being a returning starter is one thing. Hurt and being the bottom of the barrel is tough.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You can&rsquo;t make the club if you sit in the tub.</p>
		<p>Bernstein had seen this scenario before, and told Johanningmeier the horror stories about injured players in the NFL:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They want you to play. They&rsquo;ll taunt you (about) your toughness. They&rsquo;ll insult your toughness. They&rsquo;ll question your injuries. They&rsquo;ll tell you it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as bad as you think it does. They&rsquo;ve seen other guys play with that before. When are you gonna get out there and play?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not helping yourself sitting in the training room. They tell you you were playing so well before you got hurt. They get you back on the field knowing all the while that they&rsquo;re probably just going to cut you. They can&rsquo;t cut you when you&rsquo;re hurt because they have to give you some money. They want you to be out there grinding your teeth, biting the bullet, playing with enormous amounts of pain so they can get rid of you ... &ldquo;</p>
		<p>The previous day, Bernstein scuffled in practice with defensive lineman Shane Dronett. Bernstein said Dronett, a former Golden Gloves boxer who played for the Broncos, lifted his helmet and punched him three times in the jaw, dislocating it and and knocking out a tooth. The Falcons told reporters Bernstein chipped the tooth, and area papers reported it that way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You spend a couple hours a week (on game day) being happy with your job,&rdquo; said Bernstein, incredulous. &ldquo;You spend the rest of the time so miserable, in so much pain, both physical and psychological. The pain outweighs the pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Goodbye to a friend</h3>

		<p class="lead">A little more than a week later, Bernstein was one of the first players cut. He received an injury settlement, and before long landed at an Internet start-up company in Boston.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I only say this because he&rsquo;s a friend of mine, but maybe it was a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,&rdquo; Ryan said. He missed his friend, but became more optimistic after he left camp.</p>
		<p>There were moments when he figured no one else on the team cared about him, but on certain days, as many as three different coaches would ask him how he was doing.</p>
		<p>A few weeks later, he owned a sunnier disposition. He missed the trip to Tokyo the first weekend in August, but that was fine. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine what an intercontinental flight would do to his back. Besides, he would have some free time after working out, instead of the all-business, all-the-time atmosphere when camp was in session.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Staying upbeat is about the only thing I have control of at this point,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now he wants to stay,&rdquo; said his mother, Sandy Curfman, in mid-August. &ldquo;Two weeks ago, he wanted to just call it a day.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His agents had a lot to do with that. Steinberg&rsquo;s partner, Dave Dunn, pointed him toward Dr. Robert Watkins, an orthopedic spine specialist at the University of Southern California Medical Center.</p>
		<p>The Falcons allowed Johanningmeier to fly to Los Angeles to hear Watkins&rsquo; second opinion. The doctor discovered congenital spinal stenosis, or a narrowing of the spine, which explained why it was so easy for the herniated disk to create pressure on the nerves in Ryan&rsquo;s back. Now he knew what he was dealing with, and even better, the Falcons neither disputed Watkins&rsquo; diagnosis nor tried to offer Ryan an injury settlement, which effectively would have ended his pro career. No other team would pick up a player with so many major health concerns.</p>
		<p>Naturally, his parents worried more about the news.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been playing in some sort of pain now for two years straight,&rdquo; said his father, B.J. &ldquo;After a while, it&rsquo;s kind of like hitting yourself with a hammer. Everybody&rsquo;s got a breaking point of torture. It&rsquo;s just a question of when.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The Falcons moved into their new practice facility in Flowery Branch, Ga., and Johanningmeier held on as teammates around him failed to make the cut. After some confusion, he found out that the team placed him on the waived-injured list, an unusual position that bought him time with the team, but didn&rsquo;t guarantee an entire year there, like a typical injured reserve player would have.</p>
		<p>He continued to go to position meetings in late August, guessing he might never put what he was learning to use. At one point, he felt like asking Shell if he should bother going to the meetings, but then thought better of it. Still, part of him wondered if he should walk away. He was tired of the way his back felt, and he was tired of carrying around 305 pounds, which did his back no favors.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Today was probably the toughest day I&rsquo;ve had yet, because I know and everyone else knows you&rsquo;re walking the green mile,&rdquo; he said on Aug. 21, adding that right then, he felt like he&rsquo;d received only a stay of execution.</p>
		<p>Atlanta general manager Harold Richardson could offer this much assurance: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be here until he gets well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And that&rsquo;s going to take some time. Johanningmeier underwent back surgery Thursday in Los Angeles. He is looking at another eight weeks of rehabilitation in Denver, but back specialist Watkins, who has treated Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana and Troy Aikman, believes the procedure can heal him completely.</p>
		<p>Dunn predicts that only a miraculous recovery would keep Johanningmeier from staying with Atlanta for the rest of the season. Johanningmeier, who came through the surgery fine, speaks in terms of next season. He hopes the Falcons hold on to him once he heals, so he can finally show them what he can do.</p>
		<p>Still, his chances of long-term success in the NFL remain slim. His father learned about the harsh realities of pro football the hard way in his own unremarkable three-year career.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It definitely taught you that rejection is part of the process,&rdquo; said B.J., who is now a real estate broker. &ldquo;It grooms you pretty well for salesmanship.&rdquo;</p>

		</div>
		<p>Should football not work out for Ryan, though, he has an army of believers behind him. He still has an undergraduate business degree from CU and the brains to put it to work.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ryan Johanningmeier&rsquo;s going to be successful at whatever he chooses to do,&rdquo; said the University of Washington&rsquo;s Rick Neuheisel, Ryan&rsquo;s coach from 1995-98. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just that kind of kid.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Colorado coach Gary Barnett said Johanningmeier chose to play the Shrine Game over other postseason events because proceeds from the exhibition went to charity. That, he said, speaks to the person Johanningmeier is.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just got a wide perspective on things,&rdquo; Barnett said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think football&rsquo;s the most important thing in his life.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ryan says he is sick of waiting for answers and sick of his bad back, but he holds less of a grudge than Bernstein. He harbors no hard feelings toward the Falcons, who have generally treated him well. He recognizes they are acting in their best interests, and can&rsquo;t blame them for that. His agents, so often portrayed as villains, have remained in his corner from the first day. His teammates haven&rsquo;t degraded him just for being a rookie.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Cutting to the quick</h3>

		<p class="lead">A doctor has just cut into his spine and removed part of his herniated disk, as well as some of the nerve around the bone. This comes after four epidurals. And three knee scopes. And shoulder surgery. And the insertion of a screw, three-quarters of an inch wide, into his wrist.</p>
		<p>At 23, in the name of football, Johanningmeier knows more about pain than most will know in a lifetime. And he&rsquo;s learned a few side lessons along the way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Times like this, the only person who has me as the top priority is me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
